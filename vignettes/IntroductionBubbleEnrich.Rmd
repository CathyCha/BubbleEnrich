## Functions 

### Bubble graph with <code>BubbleEnrich()</code>

The <code>BubbleEnrich(geneList)</code> function returns a bubble graph of an enrichment result of disease phenotypes on a gene set of interest. 

<br>

It takes the universal enrichment analyzer, <code>enricher()</code> function from Guangchuang Yu's <code>clusterProfiler</code> package, and takes the enrichment analysis of the gene set with corresponding disease phenotypes and plots it as a bubble plot. 

<br>

Running the following lines... 

<br>

<code>data(geneList, package="DOSE")</code>

<code>BubbleEnrich(geneList)</code>

<br>

...returns the following bubble graph with -log(p.adjust) as the yaxis and BgRatio as the x axis 
<br>

<br>

For gene set enrichment analysis, we need a ranked list of genes. The DOSE package provides an example dataset geneList which was derived from R package breastCancerMAINZ that contained 200 samples, including 29 samples in grade I, 136 samples in grade II and 35 samples in grade III.

<br>


### Interactive version of BubbleEnrich with <code>BubbleEnrichShiny()</code> 

The <code>BubbleEnrichShiny()</code> function run the shiny application with <code>BubbleEnrich()</code> implemented in a user interactive, reactive application. 

<br>

With the shiny application, the user has the ability to: 
- Input their own gene sets 
- Define a enrichment cut off for size
- Change the colour of the low and high pvalues 
- Click on the plot to display contributing genes

## Data 

### DisGeNET for gene-disease annotations 

Disease to gene annotations are from DisGeNET.

```{r}
head(BubbleEnrich:::disgeneAnnot)
```



### HGNC gene id to HGNC symbol annotation

HGNC gene id to HGNC symbol annotations are from HGNC.

```{r}
head(BubbleEnrich:::HGNCAnnot)
```
